Welcome!

This application is an on-screen keyboard meant to help you 
whenever you have any issues with your physical keyboard. It 
functions 90% like a real keyboard. This was made to help 
others like me who like custom keyboards and building them. 
This application allows for the testing of a keyboard's 
functionality to ensure all switches work as intended. This 
program also is useful if your actual keyboard breaks for 
whatever reason. 

Instructions:
 - Click on individual on screen keys to type in the text box
 - Or you can just type normally using your real keyboard
 - "Shift" key allows to capitalize or access the secondary key
 - "Caps" allows to type in upper case letters
 - "Mode" allows to switch through dark and light modes
 - "Copy" allows to save the text box to your clip board
 - "Del" allows to clear the whole textbox

I hope you enjoy :)
