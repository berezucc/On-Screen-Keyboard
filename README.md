# On Screen Keyboard Application

## Description
On Screen Keyboard built with tkinter python. This application is an on-screen keyboard meant to help you whenever you have any issues with your physical keyboard. It functions 90% like a real keyboard. This was made to help others like me who like custom keyboards and building them. This application allows for the testing of a keyboard's functionality to ensure all switches work as intended.

This is my first time working with gui on python, creating github repositories, and publishing them. Project is built using 2 frames inside on one main frame. These frames are then seperated into grids which house buttons and entrys. Buttons allow to perform functions while the entry outputs onto the screen. This project taught me the importance of planning, gui and tkinter, improved my OOP skills, and let me build a functional application. 

## Installation
Running on Python 3.9.7. Ensure that pyperclip is installed. For reference, I used this [link](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-copy-to-clipboard/). Also ensure the help.txt and icon.ico files are installed.
