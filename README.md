# On Screen Keyboard Application

## Description
On Screen Keyboard built with tkinter python. This application is an on-screen keyboard meant to help you whenever you have any issues with your physical keyboard. It functions 90% like a real keyboard. This was made to help others like me who like custom keyboards and building them. This application allows for the testing of a keyboard's functionality to ensure all switches work as intended.

This is my first time working with gui on python, creating github repositories, and publishing them. 

## Installation
Running on Python 3.9.7. Ensure that pyperclip is installed. For reference, I used this [link](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-copy-to-clipboard/). Also ensure the help.txt and icon.ico files are installed.
